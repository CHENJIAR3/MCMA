#### ** You can follow this repo for the newest information. **

It is the open-source code for MCMA, which could reconstruct 12-lead ECG with arbitrary single-lead ECG. 
Before running, you should load your ECG signals, and the amplitude unit should be __mv__!!! If not, you should adjust it in advance.
Before running, you should resample this signal as 500Hz.
Before running, you can reshape it into (N,1024,1).
Additionally, the lead index should be provided. If not, you can try to find it by locating the maximum PCC. The lead index classifcaitionn accuracy in the internal testing dataset is 97.43%.

### Environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
You may fail to create your environment due to some issues, and I suggest you to pip install some packages.

### Future work
1. I have tried different setting, but more efforts in model designing are necessary for this task.
2. High quality ECG, although this study based on the public dataset, the signal quality influence its evaluation and reconstruction.
